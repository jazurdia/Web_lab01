RFC 318:
    Telnet Protocol
    April 3, 1972
    At the October 1971 Network Working Group Meeting, I promised to promptly produce a document which clearly and succinctly specified and explained the Official Telnet Protocol.  This document fails to meet any part of that promise.  This document was not produced promptly.  This document is neither clear nor succinct.  There is NO Official Telnet Protocol.

RFC 675:
    SPECIFICATION OF INTERNET TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROGRAM
    Diciembre 1974
    This document describes the functions to be performed by the
        internetwork Transmission Control Program [TCP] and its interface to
        programs or users that require its services. Several basic
        assumptions are made about process to process communication and these
        are listed here without further justification. The interested reader
        is referred to [CEKA74, TOML74, BELS74, DALA74, SUNS74] for further
        discussion.
