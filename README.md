    RFC 318:
        Telnet Protocol
        April 3, 1972
        At the October 1971 Network Working Group Meeting, I promised to promptly produce a document which clearly and succinctly specified and explained the Official Telnet Protocol.  This document fails to meet any part of that promise.  This document was not produced promptly.  This document is neither clear nor succinct.  There is NO Official Telnet Protocol.

    RFC 675:
        SPECIFICATION OF INTERNET TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROGRAM
        Diciembre 1974
        This document describes the functions to be performed by the
            internetwork Transmission Control Program [TCP] and its interface to
            programs or users that require its services. Several basic
            assumptions are made about process to process communication and these
            are listed here without further justification. The interested reader
            is referred to [CEKA74, TOML74, BELS74, DALA74, SUNS74] for further
            discussion.
